Package `hid` provides an idiomatic interface to HIDAPI, a simple library for
communicating with USB and Bluetooth HID devices on FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, and
Windows.

See https://github.com/libusb/hidapi for details.

## Installation

To add package `hid` as a dependency or upgrade to its latest version, issue:

>**Note**: Prerequisites for building HIDAPI from source must be installed prior
> to issuing `go get`. See [Prerequisites][6] for more details.

### lshid

A command named `lshid` is provided, which lists HID devices attached to the
system. `lshid` may be installed by issuing:

Once installed, issue `lshid -h` to display usage.

## Documentation
